<objective>
Verify Phase 4 space reduction changes work correctly on the live application.

Purpose: Human verification ensures the 40% height reduction target is met and the changes don't negatively impact usability. This is critical before the Friday client meeting.

Output: Verified working changes or identified issues for iteration.

  <name>Task 1: Start dev server and verify build</name>
  <files>None</files>
  <action>
1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Verify no console errors on startup

3. Run a quick build check:
```bash
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Report any TypeScript or build errors before proceeding to human verification.

  <what-built>
Order detail modal with reduced vertical spacing:
- Section spacing reduced (24px -> 12px between sections)
- Form field spacing reduced (16px -> 8px)
- Collapsible Notes (collapsed by default, click to expand)
- 2-column layouts for Order Info and Client Info

Components created:
- CollapsibleSection (reusable expand/collapse wrapper)
- CollapsibleNotes (specialized for notes with edit support)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

2. Navigate to the board view (main dashboard)

3. Click on any order card to open the Order Detail Modal

4. **Verify height reduction:**
   - Modal should feel noticeably shorter
   - Less scrolling needed to see all sections
   - Compare mentally to before (was "endless scrolling")

5. **Verify collapsible notes:**
   - Find a garment with notes - should show collapsed with small dot indicator
   - Click the Notes header - should expand smoothly with chevron rotation
   - Click again - should collapse
   - Find a garment without notes - should show collapsed, no indicator dot

6. **Verify 2-column layouts:**
   - Order Information section: Type/Status on one row, Priority/Due on next
   - Client Information section: Similar compact layout

7. **Verify readability:**
   - All text should be readable without squinting
   - Labels should be distinguishable from values
   - Nothing should feel "cramped" or overlapping

8. **Verify touch targets (if on iPad):**
   - Notes header should be easy to tap
   - Edit button should be easy to tap
   - All buttons remain tappable

9. **Verify no functionality lost:**
   - Can still edit notes (click Edit, modify, Save/Cancel)
   - Can still see all order details
   - Can still edit prices
   - All buttons work

Type "approved" if changes look good, or describe specific issues found.
