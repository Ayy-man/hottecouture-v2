<objective>
Fix remaining HIGH and MEDIUM responsive issues: workload touch targets (H1, H2), board export button overlap (H3), calendar crowding (M1), client detail tabs (M2), track timeline labels (M3), admin measurements form (M4), and pricing step input width (M6).

Purpose: These issues affect usability on touch devices. While not layout-breaking like the CRITICAL issues in Plans 01-03, they create friction in everyday workflows -- small buttons hard to tap, truncated names, overlapping UI elements. Fixing them before client testing prevents a poor first impression.

Output: All interactive elements meet 44px touch targets, layout fits within viewport at all target sizes.

NOTE: This plan depends on 21-01 (layout fixes). The workload page file is modified in 21-01 to fix h-screen -> h-full. This plan makes ADDITIONAL changes to the same file (touch targets, member select width). Read the file AFTER 21-01 has executed to see the current state.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix workload page touch targets and member select (H1, H2)</name>
  <files>src/app/board/workload/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    **Fix H1 - Unassigned item buttons:**
    Find the unassigned items section (around lines 90-120) where buttons have `h-6 px-1.5 text-[10px]` or similar small sizing.

    Change these buttons to meet 44px touch target:
    - Replace `h-6` with `h-8 sm:h-6` (32px on mobile as minimum, 24px on desktop where mouse is available)
    - Add `min-h-[44px] sm:min-h-0` to ensure touch target on mobile without affecting desktop
    - Increase text from `text-[10px]` to `text-xs` (12px) for readability

    If the buttons are div elements with onClick (not actual `<button>` elements), add `role="button"` so the global CSS touch target enforcement applies.

    **Fix H2 - Member filter select width:**
    Find the member/seamstress filter select that has `max-w-[80px]` (around lines 70-80).

    Change `max-w-[80px]` to `max-w-[120px] sm:max-w-[160px]` to allow longer names to display:
    - 120px on smallest mobile gives ~10 characters visible
    - 160px on sm+ gives ~14 characters visible
    - This is a select dropdown, so the full name shows when opened regardless

    WHY: 24px buttons are impossible to accurately tap on touch devices. 80px select width truncates most French names.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and confirm no TypeScript errors. Grep for `min-h-\[44px\]` in the file to confirm touch target enforcement.</verify>
  <done>Unassigned buttons meet 44px touch target on mobile. Member select shows at least 10 characters. TypeScript compiles clean.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Fix board export button, calendar, client tabs, track timeline, measurements form, pricing input (H3, M1-M4, M6)</name>
  <files>
    src/app/board/page.tsx
    src/app/calendar/page.tsx
    src/app/clients/[id]/page.tsx

  </files>
  <action>
    **Fix H3 - Board export button overlap at 768px:**
    In `src/app/board/page.tsx`, find the export floating button with `bottom-20 md:bottom-6` positioning.
    Change to `bottom-20 md:bottom-8` to add 8px more breathing room from the bottom on desktop. The MobileBottomNav disappears at md: (768px), so bottom-8 (32px) provides adequate clearance from the viewport edge.

    **Fix M1 - Calendar date range crowding on iPhone SE:**
    In `src/app/calendar/page.tsx`, find the date range text with `min-w-[180px]`.
    Change `min-w-[180px]` to `min-w-[140px] sm:min-w-[180px]`. This gives the nav buttons more room at 375px while keeping the wider display on larger screens. Also add `text-sm sm:text-base` to the date text if it doesn't already have responsive text sizing.

    **Fix M2 - Client detail tab buttons touch target:**
    In `src/app/clients/[id]/page.tsx`, find the tab buttons with `px-4 py-2`.
    Change `py-2` to `py-2.5 sm:py-2` which adds 4px more height on mobile (from ~36px to ~40px, closer to the 44px target). The global CSS enforcement will push these to 44px on mobile, but the explicit padding prevents visual cramping.

    **Fix M3 - Track order timeline step labels:**
    In `src/app/track/[id]/page.tsx`, find the progress timeline with 4 step labels.
    Add `text-[10px] sm:text-xs` to the step label text to prevent overlap on iPhone SE. If labels use `flex justify-between`, add `text-center` to each label to keep alignment clean.

    **Fix M4 - Admin measurements form cramped on iPhone SE:**
    In `src/app/admin/measurements/page.tsx`, find the add-field form with `grid-cols-2`.
    Change `grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` so the form stacks on mobile.

    **Fix M6 - Pricing step total override input width:**
    In `src/components/intake/pricing-step.tsx`, find the total override input with `w-24` (96px).
    Change `w-24` to `w-28 sm:w-24` (112px on mobile, 96px on desktop). The extra width on mobile accommodates larger dollar amounts and fat-finger tapping.

    WHY: Each of these is a small targeted fix that improves usability on touch devices without changing any component logic.
