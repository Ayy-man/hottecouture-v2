# Phase 10-01: Calendar Fixes

## Goal
Fix calendar scrolling, add "Assign to Me" functionality, and sort unassigned items.

## Requirements Covered
- CAL-01: Fix vertical scrolling in timeline calendar
- CAL-02: Add "Unassigned" category (already exists in workload page)
- CAL-03: Add "Assign to Me" button
- CAL-04: Sort unassigned by due date

## Current State
- Workload page exists at `/board/workload/page.tsx` with Gantt timeline
- Unassigned category already implemented
- No `/calendar` route exists (mobile nav links to it)
- Gantt has horizontal scrolling but vertical scrolling may have issues

## Implementation

### Task 1: Create calendar page redirect/alias
**File:** `src/app/calendar/page.tsx`

Create a simple calendar page that shows the workload/timeline view.

### Task 2: Fix vertical scrolling in Gantt
**File:** `src/components/ui/gantt.tsx`

- Ensure GanttTimeline has proper overflow handling
- Add vertical scrolling support to the feature list area

### Task 3: Add "Assign to Me" button
**File:** `src/app/board/workload/page.tsx`

- Import useStaffSession to get current logged-in staff
- Add "Assign to Me" button next to each unassigned item
- Call the assignment API with current staff ID

### Task 4: Sort unassigned by due date
**File:** `src/app/board/workload/page.tsx`

- Sort `unassignedWorkload.items` by dueDate ascending
- Items without due dates go to the end

## Verification
1. `/calendar` page loads correctly
2. Gantt timeline scrolls vertically when there are many features
3. "Assign to Me" button visible on unassigned items
4. Clicking "Assign to Me" assigns the item to current staff
5. Unassigned items sorted by due date (earliest first)
